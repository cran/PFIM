\section{Description}{

Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMEM) are widely used in model-based drug development and use to analyze
longitudinal data. The use of the "population" Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a good alternative to
clinical trial simulation to optimize the design of these studies. The present version, **PFIM 7.0**, is an R package that uses the S4 object system for evaluating and/or
optimizing population designs based on FIM in NLMEMs.

This version of **PFIM** now includes a library of models implemented also using the object oriented system S4 of R.
This library contains two libraries of pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) models. The PK library includes model with different
administration routes (bolus, infusion, first-order absorption), different number of compartments (from 1 to 3), and different types of eliminations
(linear or Michaelis-Menten). The PD model library, contains direct immediate models (e.g. Emax and Imax) with various baseline models, and turnover
response models. The PK/PD models are obtained with combination of the models from the PK and PD model libraries. **PFIM** handles both analytical
and ODE models and offers the possibility to the user to define his/her own model(s).
In **PFIM 7.0**, the FIM is evaluated by first order linearization of the model assuming a block diagonal FIM as in Mentré et al. (1997). The Bayesian FIM is also
available to give shrinkage predictions (Combes et al., 2013).
**PFIM 7.0** includes several algorithms to conduct design optimization based on the D-criterion, given design constraints: the simplex algorithm (Nelder-Mead) (Nelder & Mead, 1965), the
multiplicative algorithm (Seurat et al., 2021), the Fedorov-Wynn algorithm (Fedorov, 1972), PSO (*Particle Swarm Optimization*) and PGBO (*Population Genetics Based
Optimizer*) (Le Nagard et al., 2011).

\section{Documentation}{

Documentation and user guide are available at \url{http://www.pfim.biostat.fr/}
}

\section{Validation}{

**PFIM 7.0** also provides quality control with tests and validation using the evaluated FIM to assess the validity of the new version and its new
features. Finally, **PFIM 7.0** displays all the results with both clear graphical form and a data summary, while ensuring their easy manipulation in
R. The standard data visualization package ggplot2 for R is used to display all the results with clear graphical form (Wickham, 2016). A quality control using the
D-criterion is also provided.

\section{Organization of the source files in the `/R` folder}{

**PFIM 7.0** contains a hierarchy of S4 classes with corresponding methods and functions serving as constructors.
All of the source code related to the specification of a certain class is contained in a file named `[Name_of_the_class]-Class.R`.
These classes include:

1. all roxygen `@include` to insure the correctly generated collate for the DESCRIPTION file,
2. a description of purpose and slots of the class,
3. specification of an initialize method,
4. all getter and setter, respectively returning attributes of the object and associated objects.
